Week 8 Project (Food Comment App)

This week's was challenging for me even though I broadly understood the modules.

I struggled to fetch the data from the Vercel Database with the parameters. I researched a lot and I even tried using "getServerSideProps" but I still couldn't get it to work.
I also struggled to get the folders set up right so I could deploy the right App, I was getting a folder within the main App after creating the Next.js App. The Vercel deploment failed several times before I could get it to work by recreating new projects and restarting my work until I finally succeeded. 

Also my comments and add pages could not post the data I was giving it.

Due to work I've had limited time to keep trying before the deadline so unfortunately I have to submit uncompleted work.

My apologies.

These are the expectations :

Programming logic - A list of blog posts, sortable by ascending or descending order
Programming logic - A SQL schema for a posts table, and a comments table that has a post_id column connecting it to the posts table.
Modern development tools -A form to allow creating a new comment, which is saved to the new comments table including the Post ID.
Modern development tools - Refresh the /posts route data when adding a new post, and redirect the user to the list of posts
Modern development tools - A/post/:postId route which displays a new comment on the page when it is posted
